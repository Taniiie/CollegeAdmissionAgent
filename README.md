Problem Statement
College admission processes often overwhelm students due to scattered and outdated information. This project solves that by offering an AI-driven, centralized assistant for accurate and instant responses to admission-related queries.

How It Works
User asks a question (e.g., "What is the eligibility for B.Tech?")
Query is passed to a RAG pipeline
Relevant documents are retrieved

IBM Granite model generates an accurate, human-like response

Response is displayed on the UI
